# TiltTectonic

**TiltTectonic** is a simple physics-based balancing game built with **SpriteKit** and **SwiftUI**. Your goal is to tilt the platform and stack falling shapes without letting them fall off.

---

## Features

**Real-Time Physics Simulation**  
Gravity, collisions, and realistic 2D physics.

**Random Falling Shapes**  
Circles, squares, and triangles spawn unpredictably.

**Tilt Control with SwiftUI Slider**  
Smoothly adjust platform angle in real time.

**Dynamic Challenge**  
A heavy weight shifts balance unexpectedly.

**Win & Lose Conditions**  
- Win: Stack 10 shapes for 3 seconds  
- Lose: Any shape falls below the screen

**Clean SwiftUI UI**  
Modern, simple interface integrated with SpriteKit.

## Gameplay

**Objective**  
Stack 10 shapes without dropping any.

**Controls**  
Use the slider to tilt the platform left or right.

**Challenge**  
A heavy weight increases difficulty by shifting balance.

**Win Condition**  
Maintain all shapes on the platform for 3 seconds.

**Lose Condition**  
If any shape falls below the screen, you lose the game.

## My Contributions

I developed **TiltTectonic** end-to-end, including:

- Designing and implementing game mechanics in SpriteKit
- Integrating SwiftUI controls for platform tilt
- Creating random shape generation and collision logic
- Developing the weight mechanic for dynamic difficulty
- Managing game states and win/lose conditions
- Designing the SwiftUI interface
- Testing and fine-tuning physics interactions
